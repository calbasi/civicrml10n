compile-mo-files-extensions.sh - compiles the .po files to binary .mo format
for CiviCRM extensions managed by Transifex. At runtime, gettext uses the
compiled .mo format to translate strings (faster).

Run this from the base directory of the civicrm-l10n-extensions repository.
Since this is mainly a maintenance script for the CiviCRM infrastructure,
the script will assume the repository is in ~/repositories/ if the current
directory does not seem to be the correct repository.

If you compile all files (default), the script will attempt to resync the
compiled .mo files to download.civicrm.org.

NB: extensions use the full locale name, unlike core (ex: fr is fr_FR).
The short extension name is the "file" attribute in the info.xml of
the extension.

Usage:

  ./bin/compile-mo-files-extensions.sh [shortextname] [locale]

Examples:

  ./bin/compile-mo-files-extensions.sh i18nexample
  ./bin/compile-mo-files-extensions.sh i18nexample fr_FR
