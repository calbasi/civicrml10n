"The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated "

"The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts, or import them from other "

"You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also"
" create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have "
"in common. For example, you could create a group of all contacts who live in"
" California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past "
"year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal "
"categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to "
"record community member information which is specific to your community or "
"organization using custom fields. For example, you can create a set of "
"fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you "
"a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information, "

msgstr "CiviCRM 模块可以让您创建或从其他来源导入联系人。您可以记录联系人之间的关系，如是否住在同一住所。有两种类型的联系人群组，一种是静态的联系人群组，其中包含一组确定的联系人。或者可以按照联系人之间的共同特性来建立动态群组(智慧群组)，例如：可以建立一个都住在加州，而且都曾经在去年担义工的联系人群组。您也可以在CiviCRM模块中对较不正式的联系人分类或群组加标签。还可以很容易地将CiviCRM扩展，用客制化字段来记录您的社区或机构所特有的成员信息。例如，您可以创建一系列的字段来记录志愿者的技能或是偏好。CiviCRM 的数据透视图为您提供一种方式，可以让社区成员('用户')更新并分享资讯。你还能设置客制化的活动类别，如义务劳动或参与活动。"
