"The CiviCRM module stores information on the universe of people associated "

"The CiviCRM module allows you to create contacts, or import them from other "

"You can create static groups which have a set list of contacts. You can also"
" create dynamic (smart) groups based on characteristics that contacts have "
"in common. For example, you could create a group of all contacts who live in"
" California AND who have volunteered for your organization within the past "
"year. The CiviCRM module also allows for tagging for less formal "
"categorization of contacts or groups. You can easily extend CiviCRM to "
"record community member information which is specific to your community or "
"organization using custom fields. For example, you can create a set of "
"fields to track volunteer skills and preferences. CiviCRM profile gives you "
"a way to allow community members ('users') to update their own information, "
"as well as share some of that information with others. Finally, you can "
